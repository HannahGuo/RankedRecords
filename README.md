# Ranked Records

![Ranked Records](RRDesk.png)

Ranked Records is a web application that lets you create playlists that include **all** songs from an artist, ordered by either popularity or release date. It supports adding mulitple artists, and uses Spotify artist recommendations to suggest similar ones.

The project is hosted with Render, at [https://ranked-records.onrender.com/](https://ranked-records.onrender.com/).
